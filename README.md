## Wisdom

> When faced with a particularly gnarly problem, stop trying to solve the problem. Start figuring out how to not have it.
> 
> <cite>&ndash; Sophie Haskins ([source](https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/1227720471606702082))</cite>

> I hate code, and I want as little of it as possible in our product. We ship features; we do not ship code.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Jack Diederich ([source](https://youtube.com/watch?t=98&v=o9pEzgHorH0&))</cite>

> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite>

> Code without tests is broken as designed.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Jacob Kaplan-Moss</cite>

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing code in the first place. Therefore, if you write code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Brian Kernighan</cite>

> Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Harold Abelson, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i></cite>

> Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Fred Brooks, <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i></cite>

> Show me your code and conceal your data structures, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your data structures, and I won't usually need your code; it'll be obvious.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Eric Raymond, <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i></cite>

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are _obviously_ no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no _obvious_ deficiencies.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Tony Hoare</cite>

> If you try to trade off quality for speed, you'll end up with neither.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Allen Holub ([source](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1354530936063365120))

> Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite>

> The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite>

> If you wait until you can make a complete justification for a change, you've waited too long.
>
> <cite>&ndash; Eric Evans, *Domain-Driven Design*, Chapter 13: "Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight"

> The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it.
